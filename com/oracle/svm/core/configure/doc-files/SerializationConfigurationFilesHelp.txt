One or several (comma-separated) paths to JSON files that specify lists of serialization configurations.
The structure is an array of elements specifying the target serialization/deserialization class and an MD5 checksum
automatically calculated from its class contents and hierarchy by native-image-agent. The checksum is used to verify
if a serialization target class is consistent at configuration collecting time, image build time and image run time.
The use of checksum is optional, there will be no verification when the checksum is absent. The checksum algorithm
(MD5) is not collision-resistant and should thus not be used for security purposes.

Example:

    [
     {
      "name":"java.util.ArrayList",
      "checksum":"dcb00fdae89a4bd5ce2eff4af95d1f0e"
      }
    ]

It is also possible to provide multiple checksums. This is useful to support building on different JDK versions.
E.g. to support serialization of java.util.ArrayList on Java 8 and Java 11 we can use:

    [
     {
      "name":"java.util.ArrayList",
      "checksum":["c6beb425e88bf37cac00d214c582de51","dcb00fdae89a4bd5ce2eff4af95d1f0e"]
      }
    ]

Here the checksum needed for ArrayList on Java 8 is "c6beb425e88bf37cac00d214c582de51".

This JSON file format is also used for the serialization deny list. In this case the checksum field is always ignored.
